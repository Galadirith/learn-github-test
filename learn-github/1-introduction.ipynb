A version control system records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later ([About Version Control, Pro Git book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control)). GitHub is an online services that helps people share projects that use Git as their version control system.\n",

    "The environment that you are viewing this notebook in is called JupyterLab. You have access to a file browser which you can access by clicking the `Files` tab on the left hand side. You can also access a terminal window by clicking `File > New > Terminal` which can be used with common Linux commands. This will open up terminal in a new tab. You can drag this tab around to rearrange your user interface.\n",
